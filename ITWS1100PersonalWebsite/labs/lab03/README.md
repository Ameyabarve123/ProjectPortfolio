Comments about lab:

I have some lines that cut off a tag and indent to the next line. I did this to make it easier for
someone to read the code.

I used secitons and div tags, because I wanted to section out my website based on "header", 
"content", and "footer". Then inside the section I used div tags for formating within a section.

I also added spaces between sections to make it easier to see when I started a new section. 

I formated my CSS file by tags, classes, then ids for easier reading.
