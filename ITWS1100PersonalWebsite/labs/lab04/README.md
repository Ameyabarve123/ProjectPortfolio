I thought that the lab was pretty easy. There wasn't much to add for the non-extracredit portion.
The only confusing part of this lab was determining when I needed to use certain tags
(such as pubDate).

Using CSS with XML was interesting to see, as I wasn't used to working with tags other than the
common html tags we are given. I also thought it was cool to see the non-styled versions of the
RSS/Atom code, versus the styled versions.
