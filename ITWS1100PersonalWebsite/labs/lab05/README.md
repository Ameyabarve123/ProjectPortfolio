The purpose of this lab was to take input from a user, and then either submit these inputs, or 
display the user's full name and nickname to the user. 

I felt that this lab was fun to work with, as I was able to see new ways to utilize javascript. 
It also jogged my memory on how to use javascript, while also teaching me new features that I
never knew about. For example, I figured out how to use the onblur and onfocus elements,
instead of using the addEventListener element that I am used to. I also learned how to 
use the for and autofocus elements
