For lab10, we are tasked in using php to add/delete data from a sql databse.

Although time consuming, I enjoyed this lab. I found it fun and interesting figuring out how to 
manipulate a database, as this was something I had been meaning to learn for a while. I did however 
think that coding in php was a bit difficult and annoying at times, as the syntax is pretty different 
from other coding languages that I have worked with.
