The purpose of this lab was to figure out the different ways to utilize jQuery to make live 
updates to a webpage. 


I enjoyed this lab as I learned easier ways to update the look of a page using jQuery,
than compared to using js. I also felt that this lab was not too difficult, as I found that  
there is usually predefined feature in jQuery that easily accomplishes what I am trying to do
(ex: chaning the color of a tag onclick). However, I did find it a bit challenging working with 
the syntax with jQuery, because it is a bit confusing to read. More specifically, I wasn't always sure
when to use a $ or not. 


Answer to question 4:
The new lists don't turn red when clicked. This is because the new lists don't have a click feature.
