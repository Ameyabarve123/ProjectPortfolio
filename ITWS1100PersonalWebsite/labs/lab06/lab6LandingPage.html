        <h2>
          In this lab, we learned how to work with jQuery to change the look of our website.
          For example, we were tasked in changing the style of the "Your Name" text when clicked. This 
          was done by using the .css feature to change its color, style, and size. We were also tasked in
          making the hide/show/toggle buttons update the visibility of the text in the paragraph. Lastly, we had 
          to make the add lists button functional, and also allow each list's style to be changed on click.
