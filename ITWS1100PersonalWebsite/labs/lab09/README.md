For lab09, we are tasked in using AJAX to read in RSS and ATOM files into our html page. We also are tasked in styling these pages.

I felt that this lab wasn't too bad. I had to look up one function when reading in the files, 
but other than that, I felt that this lab was pretty simple. I followed my code from lab08 and felt
fine. One thing I felt that I took away from this lab however was styling my html using jQuery, which
wasn't a main focus in lab08 for me. 


.find().each()
