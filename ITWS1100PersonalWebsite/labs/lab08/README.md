The purpose of this lab was to work with AJAX to load in JSON data into our html file. 

This lab really helped me understand how to utilize AJAX/jQuery. One thing that I learned from
this was that if I am loading in data from a json file by using AJAX, I need to add click
handlers while in the AJAX function. I now also feel more comfortable with AJAX/jQuery syntax,
and have learned how to utilize new jQuery/ jQuery UI features.
