Angela Imanuel README

(9/22) Worked on styling of Events Planner page. Added and modified CSS and reorganized HTML to fit those modifications.

(9/30) Worked on styling of Home page. 

(10/2) Added Alex's Navbar to each page, ensuring the page links are working correctly.

(10/19) Reworked HTML and CSS of Home page with a new look.

(10/20) Added Footer to Home page.

(10/21) Redid styling for Professor Picker page. Created a new formatting where departments are displayed as containers rather than a drop down feature as that can get cluttered. Departments links to Courses, each course has a drop down option that shows the teaching professors. Each professor will lead to their personal page that shows the information for them teaching that class.

(10/24) Continued working on Professor Picker styling. Focused on getting Filter buttons to display dropdown on click. Redid styling of Signup and Signin page, added an admin Signin page as well.

(11/11) Worked on search function for the Professor Picker database.

(11/13) Implemented dynamic seach function for Professor Picker database. 

(11/30) Added stylized footer to all pages.

(11/31) Created Feedback Form frontend and connected with backend.

(12/2) Added sorting functionality for Professor Picker courses

(12/7 - 12/9) Added Profile Page. Changed NavBar to display Profile instead of Log Out for when users are signed. There is an admin user page and a normal user page. The admin user page has access to the admin page. Also added change password functionality. Made change so you aren't getting variables from session data to display on profile but instead directly from database.
