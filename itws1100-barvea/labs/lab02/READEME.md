I noticed that there were a lot of things from the template that I did not use. For example, I got rid of many of the ids.
I also noticed that the meta tag at the top would throw an error. I also found out that if you want your code to validate,
you can't put div tags inside ul tags, and that you should only use an id once. 

I noticed that div tags are very useful. For example, I created div tags inside of div tags, to neatly organize my website.
By doing this, I was able to easily the margins/boundaries between secitons (such as the Profile seciton and the
Education section) of my website.
